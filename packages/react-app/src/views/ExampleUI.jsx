          <strong>How does this work?</strong>
        </h2>
        <h4 style={{ padding: 14 }}>
          The Insurer interacts with the FactoryContract i.e. TurbineInsuranceFactoryPolicy (contract) and creates a
          policy. When creating the policy the the FactoryContract creates another contract i.e. TurbineInsure
          (contract) which stores all the state of the contract like windSpeed, amount, client, insurer, months the
          contract is insured as well as exact location in the form of latitudes and longitudes.
        </h4>
        <h4 style={{ padding: 14 }}>
          And If the client sees that the windSpeed is slow through whatever source he used to aquire the information
          then he can call the updateState function of the contract using the frontend which triggers the decentralised
          api call of Accuweather DataFeed Provider and state changes but every call costs 0.1 LINK token (from the
          insurance contract) . So it is important to make sure if the InsuraceContract has link.

          <strong> Technical explanation of InsuranceContract payout function</strong>
        </h3>
        <h4 style={{ padding: 14 }}>
          A function compares between two timestamps and if the windSpeed was below 15 mph for 6 hours and the api was
          called more than 4 times ( i.e. 5 times ) as well as a boolean value of contract is true then the payout
          function is triggers. Else if the windSpeed increases above 15 mph even once and then it was called so the
          boolean value is changed to false and there is no payout.
